# News Site

I wanted to make a news site about sloths and although I didn't manage to finish the whole page with more photos and text in time, you can see some kind of basic structure.  

## The problem

I had problems with flexbox and to make the page responsive so I focused on learning how to solve that and to make the basic structure look good (by studying the material for the week and attending the code and team sessions). If I had had more time I would have added more photos and text and practised more on how to divide the code in containers.
